Hall of Fame power forward/center, 3-time NBA MVP and Hall of Fame power forward/center who was the first player to move straight from high school into the NBA in 1974.</p><p>He was a part of the 1983 NBA Champion Philadelphia 76ers team with&nbsp;Julius Erving.</p><p>After the Utah Stars of the American Basketball Association (ABA) selected him in the third round of the 1974 ABA Draft, Malone decided to become a professional. The New York Times called him “the first high schooler in modern basketball to go directly to the pros”. He began his professional career with Utah in the 1974–75 season after signing a five-year contract worth $1&nbsp;million. At 6&nbsp;ft 10&nbsp;in (2.08&nbsp;m) and a somewhat skinny 215 pounds (98&nbsp;kg) at the time, Malone began his professional career playing at forward until he bulked up enough to handle the rigors at center.

He was named an ABA All-Star as a rookie and played two seasons in the league until it merged with the NBA in 1976. He landed in the NBA with the Buffalo Braves, who traded him after two games to the Houston Rockets. Malone became a five-time All-Star in six seasons with the Rockets. After leading the NBA in rebounding in 1979, he was named league MVP for the first time. He led the Rockets to the NBA Finals in 1981, and won his second MVP award in 1982. Traded to Philadelphia the following season, he repeated as MVP and led the 76ers to the 1983 championship. In his first of two stints with Philadelphia, he was an All-Star in each of his four seasons. Following another trade, Malone was an All-Star in his only two seasons with the then Washington Bullets (today’s Wizards). He signed as a free agent with the Atlanta Hawks, earning his 12th straight and final NBA All-Star selection in his first season.
