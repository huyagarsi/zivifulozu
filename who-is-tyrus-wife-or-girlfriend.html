Apart from Georgie, Tyrus’ wife has two older sons named Rhett and Rock. She had them from a previous relationship before she met and subsequently got married to Tyrus.</strong></p><h2><strong>Who is Tyrus Married to Now?</strong></h2><p>Tyrus is married to his long-time girlfriend, Ingrid Rinck, an entrepreneur and fitness enthusiast. Much isn’t known about her early life and family background, but it has been confirmed that she is 42 years old as she was born on the 24th of April 1981. Thus far, the only thing we know about the family she hails from is that her father once owned and operated a restaurant.</p><p>Although she is not college educated, she has been able to build an enviable career as a fitness trainer and a businesswoman. With the help and guidance of her father, Tyrus’ wife, Ingrid Rinck, founded Sensible Meals. The establishment is a health food shop and prepared meal service that offers its clients a variety of heat-and-eat fresh meals.</p><p>As a fitness trainer, she has accumulated over 25 years of experience with dozens of coveted certifications. So Rinck may not be popular as her famous husband, a professional wrestler and cable news personality, but she has a thriving career.</p><h3><strong>Tyrus Confirmed That He Was Married to Ingrid Rinck in 2020</strong></h3><p lang=en dir=ltr>Married for years but officially gave her a real proposal. It’s never to late to make things right! This woman is my everything and she deserves the world and it’s my honor she chose me The love of my life my life.anyone that knows her knows green <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/WZELRXzgMs</a></p><p>— Tyrus (@PlanetTyrus) <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">April 26, 2020</a></p><p>The love life of the American professional wrestler cum TV personality seems to have always revolved around his wife Ingrid Rinck. Before it became clear that she is the special woman in his life, nothing was known about Tyrus’ romantic relationships. As a matter of fact, several platforms reported that he was single and not dating anyone.</p><p>With time and seemingly out of nowhere, it became apparent that something was going on between him and a fitness trainer who was later identified as Ingrid Rinck. While the two were seen together in public multiple times and soon started living together, they were close-mouthed about their relationship. Because of that, it was hard to tell if they were married or not.</p><p>The famous wrestler put the speculations to rest in April 2020 when he confirmed that he had been married to Rinck for years. Although he didn’t specify the exact year they got married, Tyrus tweeted that he officially gave Rinck a real proposal after being married to her for years. He gifted her a gem of a ring that symbolizes her life, favorite color, her eyes, business, and their daughter’s birthstone.</p><h2><strong>How Many Children Does Tyrus Have?</strong></h2><p>The American wrestler has a total of five children thus far. As mentioned earlier, one of his five kids is a daughter named Georgia Jane. She was born on the 7th of May 2014 and is currently 9 years old. So far, Georgia is the only child that Tyrus’ wife Ingrid Rinck has birthed for him.</p><p>Apart from Georgia, Tyrus and his wife have four other children. However, they didn’t have any of them together. Before Ingrid Rinck met and began dating the famous wrestler, she had been married to another man whose identity has remained unknown to the public. With the fellow believed to be her first husband, the duo welcomed two sons named Rhett and Rock.</p><p>In the same vein, Tyrus had already had two kids before he met and fell in love with Rinck. Several reports have stated that he had a daughter and a son with his previous partner. While there is nothing that suggests this is not true, the identity of these kids has remained unknown to the public. It is also not known who their mother is.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiapa%2FHr7XGnqmimV6YvK571KxmsKCfYra0edOyqa6rXay2p7GMqKlmn5mnuae%2ByJ6lnWc%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fwho-is-tyrus-wife-or-girlfriend.html&text=Who%20is%20Tyrus%27%20Wife%20or%20Girlfriend%3f&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fwho-is-tyrus-wife-or-girlfriend.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fwho-is-tyrus-wife-or-girlfriend.html&title=Who%20is%20Tyrus%27%20Wife%20or%20Girlfriend%3f" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fwho-is-tyrus-wife-or-girlfriend.html&title=Who%20is%20Tyrus%27%20Wife%20or%20Girlfriend%3f" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fwho-is-tyrus-wife-or-girlfriend.html&title=Who%20is%20Tyrus%27%20Wife%20or%20Girlfriend%3f" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fwho-is-tyrus-wife-or-girlfriend.html&description=Who%20is%20Tyrus%27%20Wife%20or%20Girlfriend%3f" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./francesca-battistelli.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="                    Francesca Battistelli                                          Messiah lyr">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./who-is-elena-purea-everything-to-know-about-the-romanian-actress-from-the-father-who-moves-mountains.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Who Is Elena Purea?
