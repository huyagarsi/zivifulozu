Robyn stated on Instagram, “I told a friend that if Juan ever proposed, I didn’t want a diamond ring that didn’t go so well the first time, lol. I fell in love with the Pink Morganite stone cause I wanted something meaningful. Morganite represents unconditional love, which our relationship embodies and on which we have relied.”</p><p>She is currently in a very happy relationship with her family members and often shares pictures of them on her social media handle.
