Keep on scrolling to find out just what Pete Davidson's ex revealed about what it was like dating the comedian!</p><h2 id=cazzie-david-and-pete-davidson-dated-from-2016-to-2018><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>Cazzie David And Pete Davidson Dated From 2016 To 2018</span></h2><p>Let's start off with the fact that Cazzie David and Pete Davidson dated for over two years. Pete started dating Larry David’s daughter in April 2016, and they ended up going their separate ways in May 2018. At the time, the two would frequently attend industry events together, and they also showcased their love on social media.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=cazzie-revealed-that-pete-dumped-her-in-a-text><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>Cazzie Revealed That Pete Dumped Her In A Text</span></h2><p>One thing that certainly doesn't paint the greatest picture of Pete Davidson is the fact that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Cazzie David revealed that the SNL star broke up with her over a text message</a>. While breaking up over a text is something most would advise against — it seems especially inconsiderate to do that to someone one has dated for over two years. However, Pete didn't seem to want to waste any time as he moved on quickly, and breaking up in person just wasn't on his agenda.</p><h2 id=a-day-after-the-breakup-she-found-out-he-was-dating-ariana-grande><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>A Day After The Breakup She Found Out He Was Dating Ariana Grande</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Shortly after their breakup was finalized and Pete sent the text, Cazzie Davidson actually found out he was dating musician Ariana Grande through social media. This certainly makes it seem as if Pete was getting to know Ari while he was dating Cazzie, as he moved on very quickly. Here's <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">what the actress revealed</a>:</p><p>"I scrolled through Twitter and saw that my ex of one day had a new girlfriend. I think I probably left my human body. My dad held me as I shook uncontrollably in his arms for the entire flight."</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# title="Pete Davidson's Girlfriends: Which One Is The Most Popular On Instagram?">Pete Davidson's Girlfriends: Which One Is The Most Popular On Instagram?</a></span></p><p>Besides finding out about his new girl through social media, Cazzie also found out that Pete had <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">covered up his tattoos which were inspired by her</a>. Here's what Cazzie said about that:</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"The first thing I saw was a picture he'd uploaded of himself with his hand covering his face to show off his new finger tattoos. My name, which had been written in cursive across his ring finger, was now covered over with black ink. Another tattoo he had of my favorite emoji (yes, I know how f--king absurd that sounds) was now replaced with a matching tattoo he got with her of what I guess was her favorite emoji."</p><h2 id=cazzie-was-the-one-who-originally-initiated-a-break><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>Cazzie Was The One Who Originally Initiated A Break</span></h2><p>While Pete was the one who made the breakup permanent, Cazzie was actually the one who initiated it. However, she revealed this wasn't easy for her, and Pete's reaction certainly made it seem as if both were on the same page. Unfortunately, the actress regretted breaking up and when she tried to get back together with Pete, here's <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">what she revealed he told her in a phone call</a>:</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"He told me he was now the happiest he had ever been, and he wanted to continue our time apart. This 180 wasn't what I'd expected, but it wasn't unfamiliar. I said okay and that I loved him, tears streaming down my face, and he hung up quickly."</p><h2 id=the-actress-hated-the-public-breakup><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>The Actress Hated The Public Breakup</span></h2><p>Of course, no breakup is ever easy, but one that happens so publicly is surely much harder to deal with. For Cazzie, it was also particularly difficult to see her ex move on in a matter of days. The actress <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">revealed this about the attention the breakup got</a>:</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# title="The Truth About Pete Davidson And Machine Gun Kelly's Relationship">The Truth About Pete Davidson And Machine Gun Kelly's Relationship</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"My panic and shame were so far past overdrive, I couldn't articulate what it was I was even feeling. The fact that people were talking about me at all, let alone talking about me being dumped on such a large scale, was a nightmare my psyche was not equipped to handle."</p><h2 id=she-realized-that-their-relationship-wasn-39-t-unique><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>She Realized That Their Relationship Wasn't Unique</span></h2><p>One thing that Cazzie revealed in her book No One Asked For This is just how similar Pete's behavior with Ariana was to what he would be like with her. The actress revealed that plenty of things that she thought were special ended up being recycled by Pete for his new relationship. Here's <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">what Cazzie said</a>:</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"There, we bought the same matching sweatshirts they wore in the photo, except mine was Ravenclaw and hers was Slytherin, which is too ironic to make a joke about. He used to always take my hair ties off my arm and put them on, so he could 'wear a piece of me. I felt like I was being terrorized. Was he just repeating everything I'd thought had made our relationship special with someone else one day later?"</p><h2 id=but-the-two-remained-friends-after-they-split><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>But The Two Remained Friends After They Split</span></h2><p>Lastly, even though Pete Davidson broke up via text and moved on pretty quickly, it seems as if he managed to once again get on Cazzie's good side. Here's <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">what he said about the actress' tell-all book</a>:</p><p>"I'm really happy for her. It did well, and, you know, we're cool. I wish her nothing but the best. I think she wrote a really funny book and I hope it stays on the chart."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Some time has passed since their breakup, and it seems as if there is no bad blood between these two exes. Cassie even thanked Pete in the book by saying "Pete. I love you. Thank you for being encouraging when you did not have to be. Your bravery inspires me and your friendship means the world to me."</p><p><span class=next-single>Next: <a href=# title="Is Kim Kardashian And Pete Davidson's Relationship A PR Stunt?">Is Kim Kardashian And Pete Davidson's Relationship A PR Stunt?</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiamrKqnrJusMCvoJ1loJrBpnnDmq2inKOku26uzrKdq6GVo7Fw</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fcazzie-david-pete-davidson-boyfriend.html&text=Everything%20Cazzie%20David%20Taught%20Us%20About%20What%20It%27s%20Like%20Dating%20Pete%20Davidson&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fcazzie-david-pete-davidson-boyfriend.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fcazzie-david-pete-davidson-boyfriend.html&title=Everything%20Cazzie%20David%20Taught%20Us%20About%20What%20It%27s%20Like%20Dating%20Pete%20Davidson" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fcazzie-david-pete-davidson-boyfriend.html&title=Everything%20Cazzie%20David%20Taught%20Us%20About%20What%20It%27s%20Like%20Dating%20Pete%20Davidson" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fcazzie-david-pete-davidson-boyfriend.html&title=Everything%20Cazzie%20David%20Taught%20Us%20About%20What%20It%27s%20Like%20Dating%20Pete%20Davidson" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fcazzie-david-pete-davidson-boyfriend.html&description=Everything%20Cazzie%20David%20Taught%20Us%20About%20What%20It%27s%20Like%20Dating%20Pete%20Davidson" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./xenia-goodwin-wiki-age-boyfriend-net-worth.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Explore Xenia Goodwin Facts, Who Is Xenia Goodwin Boyfriend , Is She Single?">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./stanislav-khegai-net-worth.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="What is Stanislav Khegai Net Worth 2024: Maximize Your Financial Insight">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
