Selected as the fourth overall pick in the 2022 NBA draft by the Kings, Murray’s journey from his roots in Iowa to the grand stage of the NBA is nothing short of remarkable.<span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-646 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><h2 id=h-early-life><strong>Early Life</strong></h2><p>Murray’s basketball journey began at Prairie High School in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, where he first showcased his exceptional talent. As a senior, he averaged a stellar 20.3 points and 7.2 rebounds per game, earning him the coveted title of Metro Player of the Year. However, his aspirations reached further than high school accolades. To gain more exposure and hone his skills, Murray embarked on a postgraduate year at DME Academy in Daytona Beach, Florida. His decision to take this path proved pivotal.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p>At DME Academy, Murray continued to shine averaging 22.1 points and 7.5 rebounds per game. His outstanding performances did not go unnoticed as he earned the most outstanding player honors at the National Prep School Invitational. The time spent at DME Academy was instrumental in preparing him for the challenges and opportunities that awaited him in the NCAA and eventually, the NBA.</p><h2><strong>A Collegiate star in Hawkeye colors</strong></h2><p>Murray’s collegiate journey began with a commitment to the University of Iowa. Despite being a three-star recruit, he was poised to make a significant impact on the Hawkeyes’ basketball program.</p><p>In his freshman season, Murray displayed flashes of his potential. On January 2, 2021, he recorded a freshman season-high of 14 points, nine rebounds, three steals, and three blocks in a hard-fought 77–75 victory over Rutgers. His contributions did not go unnoticed as he earned a spot on the Big Ten All-Freshman Team. His freshman season averages of 7.2 points, 5.1 rebounds, and 1.3 blocks per game laid the foundation for what was to come.</p><p>Murray’s sophomore season was nothing short of spectacular. On November 16, 2021, he posted an extraordinary stat line of 27 points, 21 rebounds, and four blocks in an 86–69 triumph over North Carolina Central. This remarkable performance was the first 20-point, 20-rebound game by an Iowa player since 1977. Such moments of brilliance became a hallmark of his college career.</p><p>However, adversity struck on November 29 when Murray suffered an ankle injury during a game against Virginia forcing him to miss a crucial matchup. Nevertheless, he rebounded strongly, exemplified by a stellar performance on December 18 when he scored 35 points in a resounding 94–75 victory over Utah State. His career-high 37 points on February 13, 2022, in a 98–75 win against Nebraska showcased his scoring prowess.</p><p>On March 29, 2022, Murray made the momentous decision to declare for the 2022 NBA draft forgoing his remaining college eligibility and embarking on the next chapter of his basketball journey.</p><h2><strong>Sacramento Kings</strong></h2><p>The 2022 NBA draft held the promise of Murray’s transition to the professional ranks and it was the Sacramento Kings who saw his potential. Selected with the fourth overall pick, he brought with him a blend of athleticism, scoring ability, and versatility that would be instrumental in shaping the Kings’ future.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><p>Murray made his presence felt immediately. His summer league debut on July 2, 2022, against the Golden State Warriors was a showcase of his capabilities as he contributed a staggering 26 points and eight rebounds in an 86–68 victory. This performance marked the beginning of a remarkable journey that would see him named NBA Summer League MVP.</p><p>Throughout the summer league, Murray consistently impressed averaging 23 points, seven rebounds, two assists, and one steal while shooting an impressive 50% from the field and 40% from beyond the three-point arc. His contributions did not go unnoticed as he was also named to the All-NBA Summer League First Team further solidifying his status as a player to watch.<span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-824 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longer_content"></span><p>On October 22, 2022, Murray made his regular season debut putting up 19 points, five rebounds, and two blocks in a closely contested 111–109 loss to the Los Angeles Clippers. This debut was a glimpse of what was to come in his rookie season.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-incontent_7"></span><h2 id=h-who-is-keegan-murray-s-girlfriend-carly-printy><strong>Who is Keegan Murray’s girlfriend Carly Printy?</strong></h2><p>Carly Printy the girlfriend of Keegan Murray is a dedicated Redshirt freshman at Truman State University.
