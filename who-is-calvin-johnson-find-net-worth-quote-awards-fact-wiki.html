His name is well known on the football fields, playing as a wide receiver for the Detroit Lions of the National Football League. His professional career began in 2007 and already Johnson has put a number of career achievements under his name, including the Detroit Lions all-time career leader in receiving yards and touchdowns, fastest receiver to reach 10,000 receiving yards and NFL single-season record for most receiving yards, among others.</p><p>Have you ever wondered how rich Calvin Johnson is? According to sources, it is estimated that Calvin Johnson`s overall net worth is $30 million, an amount earned through his successful career as a football player spanning just eight years so far.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=calvin-johnson-net-worth-30-million></span>Calvin Johnson Net Worth $30 Million<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>Since his high school years, Calvin has stood out as an athlete. He attended the Sandy Creek High School and while there he tried himself as a football and baseball player, however he decided on football. With a lot of success in the next few years as a member of the High School football team, he was named the No.1 player in Georgia. Upon graduation from high school, he enrolled at Georgia Institute Of Technology, and continued with his football career, playing for the Georgia Tech Yellow Jackets. During his college career, Calvin set the record for the team with most yards received in college career, and received numerous awards, including the Biletnikoff Award in 2006 and Paul Warfield Trophy the same year. Furthermore, he was named in the All-American Team two consecutive years, 2005 and 2006.</p><p>Calvin`s professional career began with the 2007 NFL Draft, as he was selected by the Detroit Lions as a 2nd pick overall. His first contract was presented as a six-year deal, where he could earn up to $64, with $27.2 million as guaranteed money. With just this signature, Calvin`s overall net worth has only begun to increase.</p><p>He made his debut on the 9th September 2007 against the Oakland Raiders, helping his team to win with his first touchdown. In the next few games Calvin earned a nickname, Megatron, as because of his large hands he resembles Decepticons, and which follows him until the present day. Although he was injured in a game against Philadelphia Eagles, and played through the injury the whole season, this influenced his numbers, as he finished with only five touchdowns overall and 756 yards.Off course his net worth was still assured.</p><p>Calvin battled with injuries next few seasons, but his numbers increased, and his influence in the team became greater, which eventually resulted in him signing an eight-year contract worth up to $132 million, making him the highest paid player in his position in the NFL.</p><p>Other than the contract extension, his net worth benefited from bonuses through his many accomplishments in the league, including the five-time Pro Bowl appearance, three times as the First Team All Pro; twice achieving the NFL receiving yards leader, and he is a part of the 10,000 Receiving Yards Club with 10,727 yards and counting. Adding to the list of the NFL records, he is also a player with most consecutive games with at least 100 receiving yards, standing at eight.</p><p>Since 2007, when he was drafted by the Lions, he has become one of the greatest players in history of the franchise, holding several records under his name, including the most career receiving touchdowns, as he stopped at 16 in 2011 season, he also holds the record for the most seasons with 10+ receiving touchdowns in a single season with four, among others.</p><p>When it comes to his personal life, Calvin has been engaged to Britney McNorton since March 2015. Calvin is recognized as a Christian, expressing his beliefs with tattoos showing the crucifixion of Jesus on his left arm and a Christian cross on his right arm.</p><p>﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿</p><table><tr><td>Full
