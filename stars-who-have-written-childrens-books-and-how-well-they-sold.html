Many actors, singers, and athletes have done everything from starting companies to writing books. <a href=#>Many have authored children's books</a>, including Reese Witherspoon, Dolly Parton, and Seth Meyers to name just a few.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>These Young Adult Books Are Turning Into Movies</a></span></p><p>This list is by no means conclusive. There are plenty of other celebrities not on this list who have written children's books that have sold well. But for the sake of time and space, let us focus on these ten. One might wonder how well a children's book by Kelly Clarkson or <a href=#>Gabrielle Union</a> sells. Spoiler alert: most of the books on this list made it to the New York Times bestsellers list.</p><h2 id=i-39-m-not-scared-you-39-re-scared-by-seth-meyers><span class=item-num>10 </span><span>I'm Not Scared, You're Scared by Seth Meyers</span></h2><p>I'm Not Scared, You're Scared teaches children that being afraid is not a bad thing, but that it is when you let your fear control you that you have a problem. The book is an adage to the old lesson that courage is not the absence of fear, but the overcoming of fear. The book was illustrated by the artist Ray Sayegh, Jr.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=river-rose-and-the-magical-lullaby-by-kelly-clarkson><span class=item-num>9 </span><span>River Rose and the Magical Lullaby by Kelly Clarkson</span></h2><p>The American Idol star and popular TV host joined the publishing world with this story about a girl who goes on a journey thanks to a magical lullaby that is sung to her by her mother. Clarkson, a mother herself, <a href=#>wrote a second River Rose story</a> where she travels to the North Pole to meet Santa. River Rose and the Magical Lullaby <a href=#>debuted at Number 7</a> on the NYT Best Seller List.</p><h2 id=welcome-to-the-party-by-gabrielle-union><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>Welcome to the Party by Gabrielle Union</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Union has written a few books by now, ranging from serious adult topics to children and young adult literature. In total, her books have sold <a href=#>over 20 million copies</a>. The book was inspired by the birth of her daughter and is about welcoming new life into the world. It has received praise from other celebrities like the Kardashians and Jimmy Fallon (who is also on this list).</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>10 Celebrities Who Dabbled In Poetry</a></span></p><h2 id=sulwe-by-lupita-nyong-39-o><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>Sulwe by Lupita Nyong'o</span></h2><p>This bestseller by the Mexican-Kenyan actress is about a girl who wants to be beautiful, and she thinks that can only happen if her dark skin is made lighter. The book highlights the very real issue of colorism, a byproduct of racism and white supremacy. The book was highlighted on Netflix's series Bookmarks: Celebrating Black Voices.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=the-one-and-only-sparkella-by-channing-tatum><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>The One and Only Sparkella by Channing Tatum</span></h2><p>On the outside, Tatum has the face of an action hero and the body of a male stripper (he literally used to strip before he became an actor). But on his more family-friendly side, he wrote The One and Only Sparkella, which Google Books calls, "a charming ode to self-esteem." The book quickly hit number one on the NYT list <a href=#>when it came out in May 2021</a>.</p><h2 id=coat-of-many-colors-by-dolly-parton><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>Coat of Many Colors by Dolly Parton</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Named after her famous song, this book tells the story of a girl who needs a new warm winter coat. The book also uses lyrics from Parton's song. This is not Dolly Parton's only book, <a href=#>she also co-wrote a suspense novel </a>called Run Rose Run with the notorious best-selling author James Patterson.</p><h2 id=your-baby-39-s-first-word-will-be-dada-by-jimmy-fallon><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>Your Baby's First Word Will Be Dada by Jimmy Fallon</span></h2><p>Fallon's book uses pictures of cute animals to help parents and children alike come to terms with the way kids grow up. A child's first words are a pivotal turning point, and often a child's first words are either "Mama" or "Dada" as M sounds and D sounds are two of the easiest sounds for those developing language skills to make. Fallon wrote a sequel, You're Baby's First Word Will Be Mama, to make sure moms get equal representation.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>10 Movie Stars Who Are Also Accomplished Authors</a></span></p><h2 id=the-world-needs-more-purple-people-by-kristen-bell><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>The World Needs More Purple People by Kristen Bell</span></h2><p>This book plays on the old phrase "I don't care if someone is black, white, or purple, but..." The phrase is often said before a tone-deaf or racist comment, but Bell uses that as a jumping-off point to create the idea that a purple person is fun, accepting, loving, and a joy to be around. The book is recommended by <a href=#>SocialJusticeBooks.org</a> and it quickly became number 1 on the bestseller list.</p><h2 id=busy-betty-by-reese-witherspoon><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>Busy Betty By Reese Witherspoon</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>This book is the newest on this list at the time it was written, it came out in <a href=#>October 2022</a>. Witherspoon has already written other books, most of them for children. Busy Betty is a story about a girl who faces a big challenge when she is tasked with bathing her dog.</p><h2 id=the-adventures-of-qai-qai-by-serena-williams><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>The Adventures Of Qai Qai by Serena Williams</span></h2><p>Serena Williams might have retired from Tennis in 2022, but now she has plenty of time for her hobbies, like her pottery and her writing. In this story, a little girl learns to believe in herself thanks to the help of her doll Qai Qai, which comes to life to take the little girl on all sorts of adventures. The book was praised in <a href=#>Oprah Daily,</a> a feat that many authors seek to achieve besides the NYT list.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiqrZmiqHq4tM5mn5qulWLEs7XTrZynZZOdtq2w0Z6lrGWSpLysv4yapZ1lmKTEbsPEpaNmrJiaxm6%2FzqWbaA%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fstars-who-have-written-childrens-books-and-how-well-they-sold.html&text=10%20Stars%20Who%20Have%20Written%20Children%27s%20Books%2c%20And%20How%20Well%20They%20Sold&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fstars-who-have-written-childrens-books-and-how-well-they-sold.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fstars-who-have-written-childrens-books-and-how-well-they-sold.html&title=10%20Stars%20Who%20Have%20Written%20Children%27s%20Books%2c%20And%20How%20Well%20They%20Sold" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fstars-who-have-written-childrens-books-and-how-well-they-sold.html&title=10%20Stars%20Who%20Have%20Written%20Children%27s%20Books%2c%20And%20How%20Well%20They%20Sold" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fstars-who-have-written-childrens-books-and-how-well-they-sold.html&title=10%20Stars%20Who%20Have%20Written%20Children%27s%20Books%2c%20And%20How%20Well%20They%20Sold" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fstars-who-have-written-childrens-books-and-how-well-they-sold.html&description=10%20Stars%20Who%20Have%20Written%20Children%27s%20Books%2c%20And%20How%20Well%20They%20Sold" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./colin-farrell-calls-sober-sex-terrifying-talks-sex-tape-2014132.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Colin Farrell Calls Sober Sex &amp;quot;Terrifying,&amp;quot; Talks Sex Tape">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./what-is-a-scallywag-definition.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="What is a scallywag definition">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
