Three other hospital staff members who were injured are now in stable condition, according to Chilimuri.</p><p class="Ekqk nlgH yuUa lqtk TjIX aGjv">The sixth person injured was a patient at the hospital who remains in stable condition and may be released soon, Chilimuri said.</p><p class="Ekqk nlgH yuUa lqtk TjIX aGjv">Chilimuri appeared optimistic that all victims will ultimately recover.</p><p class="Ekqk nlgH yuUa lqtk TjIX aGjv">"We think we’ll end up with good outcomes in the end," he told reporters.</p><p class="Ekqk nlgH yuUa lqtk TjIX aGjv">The doctor killed in the rampage has been identified as 32-year-old Tracy Sin-Yee Tam, of Queens.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/s.abcnews.com/images/US/RT-new-york-hospital-shooting-1-jt-170701.jpg><p class="Ekqk nlgH yuUa lqtk TjIX aGjv">New York City Mayor <a class="zZyg UbGl iFzk qdXb WCDh DbOX tqUt GpWV iJYz" data-testid=prism-linkbase href=# id="ramplink_Bill de Blasio_">Bill de Blasio</a> called the shooting a "horrific" instance of what appeared to be workplace violence, leaving several victims "fighting for their lives."</p><p class="Ekqk nlgH yuUa lqtk TjIX aGjv">Gunshots rang out at Bronx-Lebanon Hospital Center just before 3 p.m. Friday. According to police sources, the suspected gunman, Dr. Henry Bello, went to the hospital's 16th floor with an AR-15 assault rifle hidden under his white hospital coat to look for another doctor against whom he apparently harbored a longstanding grudge.</p><p class="Ekqk nlgH yuUa lqtk TjIX aGjv">Bello allegedly posed as a doctor in order to enter the hospital. Hospital spokesman Errol Schneer said security usually check IDs and it's unclear how the suspect got through.</p><p class="Ekqk nlgH yuUa lqtk TjIX aGjv">"There was no warning whatsoever that he would return or that he would ever take this kind of action," Schneer told reporters Saturday morning.</p><p class="Ekqk nlgH yuUa lqtk TjIX aGjv">When he was told that the doctor wasn’t there, Bello opened fire, the sources said, wounding six people.</p><p class="Ekqk nlgH yuUa lqtk TjIX aGjv">Bello then went to the 17th floor, where he encountered Tam in a hallway and fatally shot her, according to the sources.</p><p class="Ekqk nlgH yuUa lqtk TjIX aGjv">The alleged killer then attempted to set himself on fire, triggering the hospital's fire sprinklers, which quelled the flames. He then shot himself in the head, sources said.</p><p class="Ekqk nlgH yuUa lqtk TjIX aGjv">The names of those injured have not been released.</p><p class="Ekqk nlgH yuUa lqtk TjIX aGjv">At the Saturday morning conference, hospital officials said the doctor who was fatally shot had worked at Bronx-Lebanon Hospital Center for nearly a year. She was covering another physician's shift at the time of the shooting and normally would not have been there on that day, officials said.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/s.abcnews.com/images/US/EPA-new-york-hospital-shooting-2-jt-170701.jpg><p class="Ekqk nlgH yuUa lqtk TjIX aGjv">Chilimuri said the hospital was, in a sense, "well prepared" for such a shooting, as nurses and doctors immediately stepped up to tend to the wounded, evacuate patients and some even risked their own lives protecting those who couldn't be moved. He said hospital staff were able to move some 50 patients out of the hospital within 10 minutes.</p><p class="Ekqk nlgH yuUa lqtk TjIX aGjv">"Everyone did what they had to do," Chilimuri told reporters. "They were protecting the patients while the remaining staff were taking care of people who were injured."</p><p class="Ekqk nlgH yuUa lqtk TjIX aGjv">According to police sources Bello had four prior arrests, the most serious being for sexual abuse in August 2004 when he lifted a 23-year-old woman up by her crotch outside a building on Bleecker Street in downtown New York City.</p><p class="Ekqk nlgH yuUa lqtk TjIX aGjv">Bello had previously pleaded guilty to unlawful imprisonment, a misdemeanor, and was sentenced to community service, the sources said.</p><p class="Ekqk nlgH yuUa lqtk TjIX aGjv">In 2009, Bello was charged with unlawful surveillance for allegedly peering under a victim’s clothing, according to the sources. And in 2003, he was charged with fare beating and burglary.</p><p class="Ekqk nlgH yuUa lqtk TjIX aGjv">Further information on those cases, as well as the statuses, are still unavailable.</p><p class="Ekqk nlgH yuUa lqtk TjIX aGjv">Bello began working at Bronx-Lebanon Hospital Center in August 2014, and the hospital wasn't aware of his criminal record at the time. He used to work on the hospital's 16th floor, where Friday's shooting occurred, according to Schneer.</p><p class="Ekqk nlgH yuUa lqtk TjIX aGjv">Bello handed in his resignation in February 2015 in lieu of being terminated, Schneer said. Police sources Bello resigned before he was terminated amid allegations he sexually harassed a co-worker.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/s.abcnews.com/images/US/AP-new-york-hospital-shooting-3-jt-170701.jpg><p class="Ekqk nlgH yuUa lqtk TjIX aGjv">A 45-year-old Nigerian national, Bello attended medical school in the Caribbean, sources said. Although he wasn't a licensed doctor in the United States, he was working under a limited state-issued permit. He had previously been issued a pharmacy technician license in California in 2006, around the time he was at University of Southern California, according to the sources.</p><p class="Ekqk nlgH yuUa lqtk TjIX aGjv">According to The New York Daily News, Bello <a class="zZyg UbGl iFzk qdXb WCDh DbOX tqUt GpWV iJYz" data-testid=prism-linkbase href=#>sent an email</a> to the newspaper just two hours before the shooting, in which he blamed his former workplace for ruining his career.</p><p class="Ekqk nlgH yuUa lqtk TjIX aGjv">“This hospital terminated my road to a licensure to practice medicine,” Bello wrote in the email, according to the Daily News. “First, I was told it was because I always kept to myself. Then it was because of an altercation with a nurse.”</p><p class="Ekqk nlgH yuUa lqtk TjIX aGjv">Bello continued, "Then I was told, it was because I threatened a colleague."</p><p class="Ekqk nlgH yuUa lqtk TjIX aGjv">In the note, Bello accuses a specific female doctor, whose name was redacted from the email, of sending "an email to everybody telling them to file complaints against me so I can be terminated for being rude to her."</p><p class="Ekqk nlgH yuUa lqtk TjIX aGjv">Bello then appears to blame a specific male doctor, whose name was also redacted, for "blocking" his dreams of furthering his career and wasting "$400,000 of my money."</p><p class="Ekqk nlgH yuUa lqtk eTIW sUzS">ABC News' Tara Fowler and Michael Edison Hayden contributed to this report.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiZkpi7psPSZ56oZpOkunChsmitopuknrq0edGepJqhnmKws7XTopqapF2YvK%2BwyK2gqKZdmbKisMuyZJuqn6PFbrTOrKeirJGherS0zqiroqaXZMC1u9GydqKcbWmFdIWQcW5v</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fvictims-remain-critical-condition-deadly-bronx-hospital-shooting.html&text=2%20victims%20remain%20in%20critical%20condition%20after%20deadly%20Bronx%20hospital%20shooting&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fvictims-remain-critical-condition-deadly-bronx-hospital-shooting.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fvictims-remain-critical-condition-deadly-bronx-hospital-shooting.html&title=2%20victims%20remain%20in%20critical%20condition%20after%20deadly%20Bronx%20hospital%20shooting" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fvictims-remain-critical-condition-deadly-bronx-hospital-shooting.html&title=2%20victims%20remain%20in%20critical%20condition%20after%20deadly%20Bronx%20hospital%20shooting" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fvictims-remain-critical-condition-deadly-bronx-hospital-shooting.html&title=2%20victims%20remain%20in%20critical%20condition%20after%20deadly%20Bronx%20hospital%20shooting" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fvictims-remain-critical-condition-deadly-bronx-hospital-shooting.html&description=2%20victims%20remain%20in%20critical%20condition%20after%20deadly%20Bronx%20hospital%20shooting" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./griffin-santopietro-parents-father-daniel-santopietro-and-mother-amanda-larusso.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Griffin Santopietro Parents: Father Daniel Santopietro And Mother Amanda LaRusso">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./kramers-racist-tirade-caught-on-tape.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="                              &amp;quot;Kramer's&amp;quot; Racist Tirade -- Caught on Tape                         ">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
