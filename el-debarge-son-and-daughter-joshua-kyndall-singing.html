OMG,” and “Genes are something else!!!! This blessed me.”</p><p>Before long, the short clips went viral and found themselves on the X platform, with fans just as enamored by the next generation’s voices as they were with El DeBarge’s.</p><p>One person said, “I follow Kyndall and her husband’s videos but didnt know shes el’s daughter, she got his singing voice and making it hers.”</p><p>“El DeBarge singing with his kids Josh & Kyndall has me in tears.

Over the past few years, the 62-year-old, who was once estranged from his family, has made great strides in rebuilding a relationship with his offspring.</p><p>El has 12 children, 11 of whom are his biological children and one that he has accepted as his own, by five different women.</p><p>In a 2018 interview with Jet magazine, he openly admitted that his 22-year struggle with drug addiction prevented him from being the kind of father that a sober version of himself would have aspired to be. The repercussions of his addiction led to one of his children, then just 3 years old, being removed from his and the mother’s custody and placed in the system. “I don’t know where she is,” he lamented, suspecting that she may have been adopted.</p><p>Now, clean and sober, he said he is aiming to be the best dad he can be and will never abandon his children again.</p><p>“I intend to be in their lives forever,” he <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">said</a>. “God gave me a second chance. I am so very glad with what is going on with my career, but I want to be a success in my relationship with my children.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiZpKGur8DAm6Oam5uowaK%2BjZympmdiZX90e5BrZmxpX5q5brDEm5irn5ViwLC6jJqlnWWUlsKotNOeqWain6i1tq2MpLCnnJGhuW6%2FyKeeoqaXZA%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fel-debarge-son-and-daughter-joshua-kyndall-singing.html&text=Proof%20That%20Cloning%20Is%20REAL%21%3a%20El%20DeBarges%20Son%20and%20Daughter%20Joshua%20and%20Kyndall%20Mesmerize%20Fans&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fel-debarge-son-and-daughter-joshua-kyndall-singing.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fel-debarge-son-and-daughter-joshua-kyndall-singing.html&title=Proof%20That%20Cloning%20Is%20REAL%21%3a%20El%20DeBarges%20Son%20and%20Daughter%20Joshua%20and%20Kyndall%20Mesmerize%20Fans" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fel-debarge-son-and-daughter-joshua-kyndall-singing.html&title=Proof%20That%20Cloning%20Is%20REAL%21%3a%20El%20DeBarges%20Son%20and%20Daughter%20Joshua%20and%20Kyndall%20Mesmerize%20Fans" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fel-debarge-son-and-daughter-joshua-kyndall-singing.html&title=Proof%20That%20Cloning%20Is%20REAL%21%3a%20El%20DeBarges%20Son%20and%20Daughter%20Joshua%20and%20Kyndall%20Mesmerize%20Fans" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fel-debarge-son-and-daughter-joshua-kyndall-singing.html&description=Proof%20That%20Cloning%20Is%20REAL%21%3a%20El%20DeBarges%20Son%20and%20Daughter%20Joshua%20and%20Kyndall%20Mesmerize%20Fans" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./the-view-bridgerton-mirror-sex-scene-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="The View Is ProSex Scene in the Case of Bridgerton">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./photos-teyana-taylor-hair-style-and-transformation.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Photos: Teyana Taylor Hair Style And Transformation Covered">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
