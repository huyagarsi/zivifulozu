She is best known for her Internet character Miranda Sings, posting videos of the character on YouTube, performing her one-woman comedy act on tour in theatres worldwide, and creating a Netflix original television show based on the character. Ballinger created the comically talentless, egotistical and eccentric character to satirize the many YouTube videos featuring people singing badly in hopes of breaking into show business, but who appear unaware of their lack of talent. In her videos and stage act, the narcissistic character sings and dances badly, discusses current events that she misunderstands, gives inept “tutorials”, collaborates with other YouTubers, and rants about her critics, whom she calls the “haters”. Ballinger conceived, produced, wrote for and starred as Miranda in the Netflix series Haters Back Off, which explored Miranda’s origins and family life; the series ran for two seasons in 2016 and 2017. She also starred as Miranda in a Netflix comedy special in 2019 and continues to tour as the character.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Net Worth</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>$8 Million</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Salary</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Under Review</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Source of Income</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>YouTube Star</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Cars</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>House</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Living in own house.</td></tr></tbody></table><p>Since April 2009, Ballinger has performed a one-woman comedy act, as Miranda Sings, at first in cabaret spaces and later in theatres in New York, London, and other cities in the US, UK, Australia, Europe, Canada and elsewhere. BroadwayWorld.com called Miranda “the hottest, freshest and oddest breakout star in the musical theatre/cabaret scene”.</p><p>Ballinger based the character partly on young women that she knew in college. She told The Times of London, “There were a lot of cocky girls who thought they were really talented, and they … were so rude and snotty…. Then I saw all these girls trying to make a career out of putting videos on YouTube [of themselves singing in their bedrooms] … clueless to the fact that they were terrible.” At first, the “Miranda videos were meant to be an inside joke” among Ballinger’s friends. In March 2009, however, a Miranda video called “Free Voice Lesson” quickly became a sensation. The video consists of bad advice about singing technique. Miranda’s videos drew predictably sharp criticism on YouTube, and as they became popular, Ballinger modified the character in response to the negative comments. She says: “I took what people hated and exaggerated it more in the next video.” The online critics were so harsh that Miranda became a “hero of the anti-bullying movement”. Ballinger uses “humour and satire to challenge ideas of popular femininity. … Miranda Sings … puts on monstrous makeup to perform parody music videos [rejecting] being conventionally pretty.”</p><h2>Height, Weight & Body Measurements</h2><p><b>Colleen Ballinger height</b> <strong>5 ft 6 in</strong> Colleen <strong>weight</strong> Not Known & <strong>body measurements</strong> will update soon.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Height</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>5 ft 6 in</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Weight</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Known</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Body Measurements</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Under Review</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Eye Color</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Hair Color</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Feet/Shoe Size</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr></tbody></table><p>Ballinger was born and raised in Santa Barbara, California, the daughter of Tim Ballinger, a sales manager, and his wife Gwen, a homemaker.
