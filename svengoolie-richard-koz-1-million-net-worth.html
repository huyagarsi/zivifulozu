Thanks to the work of people like Vampira, Elvira, the Mystery Science Theater 3000 (MST3k) team, Rifftrax, and several others, the genre endures.

One other such host who deserves credit for bringing classic and B-horror films to a wider audience this way is Richard Koz, who is known by his character name, Svengoolie, which is also the name of his show. Thanks to his dedication to the genre, the national syndication of his program out of his home town (Chicago), and the antics of his rubber chicken pal Kerwyn, Svengoolie has endured for almost 40 years. But many outside of the midwest might not know about his hilarious endeavors because Koz is not as well known as Elvira or MST3k, but the host still has a solid fanbase who have followed him from his earliest episodes to today.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=richard-koz-started-in-radio><span class=item-num>9 </span><span>Richard Koz Started In Radio</span></h2><p>Koz got his start in radio, as many television hosts do. After finishing school at Northeastern University, Koz found himself working in television. In high school, he started to develop a love of film, especially the classic Universal horror monsters like Frankenstein, The Wolfman, and his favorite The Creature From The Black Lagoon. It was also in high school his career in broadcasting began with a student-run DJ gig for WMTH-FM.</p><h2 id=richard-koz-isn-rsquo-t-the-first-to-play-svengoolie><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>Richard Koz Isn’t The First To Play Svengoolie</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Koz is actually the second generation of the Svengoolie name. The first Svengoolie was played by <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Jerry G Bishop</a>, another Chicago disc jockey and mentor to Koz. Bishop did his version of Svengoolie from 1970-1973. The original show, titled Screaming Yellow Theater, featured Bishop's character as a hippie-haired horror host hiding behind sunglasses and a cheesy Transylvanian accent. While his rendition of Svengoolie was a little different from Koz’s, both are considered pieces of Chicago history.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>How Joel Hodgson Saved His Show 'Mystery Science Theater 3000'</a></span></p><h2 id=richard-koz-started-his-show-in-1979><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>Richard Koz Started His Show In 1979</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>After Bishop retired from Svengoolie in 1973, Koz saw an opportunity to do his own show and pay homage to his mentor. In 1979, with permission from Bishop, Koz aired the first episode of Son Of Svengoolie, a sequel to Bishop’s original character where Svengoolie’s son, dressed in a top hat and a painted-on devil beard, would resume the show and feature jokes and songs in between commercial breaks. Koz’s show was a little more ambitious, as it had more props, more jokes, and a few puppet sidekicks like Kerwyn the chicken and Sven’s talking coffin. Son Of Svengoolie won multiple local Emmys before being canceled.</p><h2 id=richard-koz-rebooted-the-show-in-1995><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>Richard Koz Rebooted The Show In 1995</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Son of Svengoolie aired until 1986, then Koz took a bit of a hiatus after the show was canceled by the network. That was until 1995, when it came time for him to reintroduce the show. This time, however, Bishop advised Koz that it was time to drop the “Son of” from his name and that he should take ownership of the Svengoolie brand. Koz gratefully obliged, and thus the Svengoolie that audiences know and love today was born.</p><h2 id=39-svengoolie-39-got-picked-up-by-me-tv><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>'Svengoolie' Got Picked Up By Me-TV</span></h2><p>Eventually, Svengoolie began to develop a cult following outside of Chicago as the show would reach audiences in Indianapolis, Minneapolis, and several other parts of the upper midwest. Eventually ME-TV, which specializes in broadcasting classic television shows, signed Svengoolie onto their network, and thus, Svengoolie is now a nationally syndicated show.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=richard-koz-tours-the-convention-circuit><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>Richard Koz Tours The Convention Circuit</span></h2><p>Although the COVID-19 pandemic was a major setback for Koz, one thing that helped him gain national celebrity and made him a success was his appearances at comic book and sci-fi conventions. At these conventions, he is not only meeting with fans and signing autographs, he also gets the good fortune to interview celebrities and stars of his favorite films.</p><h2 id=richard-koz-has-some-celebrity-fans-from-mark-ruffalo-to-gilbert-godfried><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>Richard Koz Has Some Celebrity Fans, From Mark Ruffalo To Gilbert Godfried</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Thanks to his interviews at conventions, we know that Svengoolie has quite an impressive fanbase. Stars like Mark Ruffalo and Gilbert Godfried have made appearances on his show and shown proper gratitude. Also, Koz is a huge wrestling fan and several wrestlers, like the now-retired Mike Foley, have made appearances with Chicago’s favorite horror guru.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>This Jim Carey Classic Was Supposed To Be A Horror Movie</a></span></p><h2 id=richard-koz-has-a-39-svengoolie-39-merch-store><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>Richard Koz Has A 'Svengoolie' Merch Store</span></h2><p>Thanks to signing with ME-TV, Koz was given an ample avenue to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">merchandise </a>the Svengoolie name with minimal overhead. Every episode of Svengoolie, (Saturdays at 8pm on ME-TV) features at least one ad for his now-famous glow in the dark shirts, and a segment of his show is dedicated to sending shout-outs to fans who send in pictures of themselves with his shirt on at major historical landmarks or famous horror museums and film shooting locations. Svengoolie merchandise also includes hats, mugs, and bobbleheads.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=richard-koz-is-a-chicago-icon-worth-1-million><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>Richard Koz Is A Chicago Icon, Worth $1 Million</span></h2><p>All in all, what makes Svengoolie so popular and so endearing to his fans is his humble roots and approach to television. While Me-TV has been good for his career, it is not as lucrative of a deal as what people like Elvira or MST3k have found for themselves. However, in addition to his humble <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">beginnings on local Chicago television</a>, fans seem to appreciate this low-key approach. Svengoolie is one of Me-TVs most-watched shows, and technically it is their first original program. While not living in luxury, his net worth is estimated to be around $1 million, a modest yet comfortable amount.</p><p><span class=next-single>Next: <a href=#>How Bruce Campbell Became An Action-Horror Icon Worth $10 Million</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiqr52enLywuMieZKuhk52us7CMpKazZWFiuqq4y6Kmp2WemsFuw86rq6Fn</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fsvengoolie-richard-koz-1-million-net-worth.html&text=Who%20Is%20Svengoolie%2c%20And%20Why%20Is%20He%20Worth%20So%20Much%20Money%3f&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fsvengoolie-richard-koz-1-million-net-worth.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fsvengoolie-richard-koz-1-million-net-worth.html&title=Who%20Is%20Svengoolie%2c%20And%20Why%20Is%20He%20Worth%20So%20Much%20Money%3f" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fsvengoolie-richard-koz-1-million-net-worth.html&title=Who%20Is%20Svengoolie%2c%20And%20Why%20Is%20He%20Worth%20So%20Much%20Money%3f" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fsvengoolie-richard-koz-1-million-net-worth.html&title=Who%20Is%20Svengoolie%2c%20And%20Why%20Is%20He%20Worth%20So%20Much%20Money%3f" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fsvengoolie-richard-koz-1-million-net-worth.html&description=Who%20Is%20Svengoolie%2c%20And%20Why%20Is%20He%20Worth%20So%20Much%20Money%3f" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./ari-shaffir-moves-from-censorship-to-creative-control-with-double-negative-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Ari Shaffir Moves from Censorship to Creative Control with Double Negative">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./bestselling-adidas-running-shoes-sneakers-amazon-sale-deal.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Shop These Bestselling Adidas Sneakers  On Sale for 70% Off">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
